## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft lavender (#E6E6FA) for a calm and modern feel. A light, desaturated hue choice supports prolonged screen use and contributes to a sense of tranquility.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F5F5F5) to provide a clean, neutral backdrop. This choice helps to avoid distraction and allows the chat content to stand out.
- Accent color: Muted violet (#9400D3) for interactive elements. As an analogous color, violet is naturally harmonious with lavender but, by manipulating its saturation and brightness, it can provide distinctiveness.
- Clean, sans-serif font for readability in chat messages.
- Use simple, line-based icons for a modern and clean look.
- Spacious and well-organized layout for easy readability.
- Subtle transitions and animations for a smooth user experience.
